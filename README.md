# Bayesian-Correlations-for-Count-Data

This repository contains R code for Bayesian correlation computations for sequence count data, as described in the paper "Bayesian Correlation Analysis for Sequence Count Data" by Sanchez-Taltavull, Ramachandran, Lau, and Perkins, in PLoS ONE, Vol. 11, No. 10, Art. e0163595 (2016). To use, simply 'source' the file, and then run whichever functions you like on the data. The first function allows you to specify your own condition-specific priors, while the subsequent functions implement the three priors described in the paper.
